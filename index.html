		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>
			I am a computer scientist and cryptography research student from New Zealand, currently completing a PhD in mathematics at the University of Auckland.
			I am particularly interested in digital signature schemes, elliptic curves, and supersingular-isogeny based cryptosystems.
			My other academic interests include cyber security, algebraic number theory, algebraic geometry, and mathematical computer science such as logic, category theory, and programming language theory.
		</p>
		<p>
			Outside of university, one of my biggest interests is Bitcoin. I am an ex-maintainer of <a href="http://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin">Bitcoin Core</a>, a role in which I was primarily focused on development of the Bitcoin Core wallet. Particular interests of mine in the Bitcoin space are the <a href="https://github.com/sipa/bech32">Bech32</a> checksum, descriptors, and <a href="https://github.com/sipa/miniscript">Miniscript</a>.
			I also moderate the Bitcoin StackExchange and am an administrator of the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/User:MeshCollider">Bitcoin Wiki</a>.
			I have given a number of talks on Bitcoin and the cryptography behind it to various groups. My focus is almost exclusively on the technology and code - I do not provide financial advice.
		</p>
		<p>
			Previously I have worked as a freelance programmer, tutor, and a consultant for various local companies.
			Past jobs I have been involved in have ranged from backend web development to android apps.
			I enjoy coding and have competed in programming contests such as the ICPC, in which I was a world finalist in 2019, representing the University of Auckland.
